## Description
The computer first selects a random number between 1-50. Then the user guesses a number, the program will then provide the user with feedbck telling them if their guess was too high, too low or correct. If their guess was not correct, the program loops back to where the user can guess again. However, if the user guesses correctly, the program will end.
